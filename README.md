# Transplant-Patient-Records
Created a program that used struct, enum, and text file I/O. The program allowed a nurse (user) to input and store a patientâ€™s information: full name, blood type, organ, age, and year added in a struct. The program displayed the options to add or remove patients from the list, view the current list, and save the records of patients to a text file.
